**GenoDrive V12** is a futuristic, professional-grade dashboard designed for the next generation of data storage: **Digital-to-DNA synthesis**. By leveraging advanced mathematical erasure coding and biological encryption analogies, it provides a "Universal Cold Storage" solution for your most sensitive digital artifacts.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 💎 1. Molecular Sharding (Resilience)
Utilizes the **Cauchy MDS (Maximum Distance Separable) Matrix** to fragment any file into 10 unique shards (6 Data + 4 Parity). 
- **The "Waaah" Factor:** Your data can survive the loss of any 4 fragments. As long as you have 6 out of 10 shards, the "Molecular Resurrection" engine can perfectly reconstruct the original file.

### 🔐 2. Universal Cold Storage
Perfect for high-stakes digital assets:
- **Private Keys & Seed Phrases:** Securely fragment your crypto keys.
- **Inheritance Mode:** Distribute shards among family members; the secret is only revealed when the "Bio-Vault" grid is unified.
- **Sensitive Documents:** PDF, TXT, and JSON support with a built-in **Secure Viewer**.

### 🧪 3. Genetic Security PIN
Implements a user-defined **Genetic Security PIN**. This seed determines the "Bio-Scrambling" pattern. Without the correct PIN, even a successful reconstruction will result in "Molecular Noise," ensuring a secondary layer of encryption.

### 🧬 4. DNA Flux Visualization
Watch in real-time as your binary data is mapped to **A, C, G, and T** nucleotide sequences. The V12 engine optimizes GC-content and homopolymer checks for maximum biological stability.

### 🤖 5. AI Bio-Assistant
Integrated with **Google Gemini API**, providing real-time system monitoring and explaining complex genetic synthesis steps in a friendly, futuristic lab-assistant tone.

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

- **Engine:** GF(256) Galois Field Arithmetic.
- **Algorithm:** Reed-Solomon style Erasure Coding via Cauchy Matrices.
- **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- **AI Integration:** Google GenAI (Gemini 3 Flash).
- **Compression:** Dynamic binary-to-nucleotide mapping.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome/Edge recommended).
- A valid **Google Gemini API Key** (set in your environment as `process.env.API_KEY`).

### Running Locally
Since this project uses ES6 modules and a streamlined frontend structure:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/genodrive-v12.git
   cd genodrive-v12
   ```

2. **Setup Environment:**
   Ensure your execution environment has access to the Gemini API Key.

3. **Launch:**
   Open `index.html` through a local development server (like VS Code Live Server or Vite) to handle the ES6 module imports.

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Synthesis Mode:** Upload your file (Image, Key, or Document) and set your **Genetic Security PIN**.
2. **Splicing:** Wait for the V12 engine to map your binary to DNA sequences.
3. **Vaulting:** Download the generated `.gdv` fragments.
4. **Resurrection:**
   - To test: Delete some fragments in the Vault and see the MDS engine recover the data.
   - External: Upload 6+ `.gdv` files to the "External Resurrection" tab to pull data back from the bio-void.
